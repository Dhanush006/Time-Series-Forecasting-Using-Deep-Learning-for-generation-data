# Time-Series-Forecasting-Using-Deep-Learning-for-generation-data
<!-- The Project was a study of how closely time series predictions and forecasting can be made on stochastic time models modelled using different artificial neural networks namely LSTM and GRU.
The given datasets include an irradiation data set and a generation data set
which contain basically the irradiance values detected by the sensors and the
power generation values by the plant in (kwh) respectively.

The datasets contain data corresponding to all the 12 months starting from
december 2018 to november 2019, with the data being recorded for every 15
mins of any given day.

The main goal of the project stood in finding out the best suitable ANN
architecture for forecasting the generation data for the next two days
starting from any given day, in the intervals of 15,30,45,60 mins.

The whole project was carried out through coding in matlab. -->
